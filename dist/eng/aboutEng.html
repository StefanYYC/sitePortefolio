          <p>
            Since I'm in middle School, I got IT as a hobby, there was no doubt
            that I was going to study in this area, and that's what I did !
            <br />
            Today, I decided to get more into web development and all around
            front-end. I do like hardwares but it's more something like a hobby
            that I do on side. On the professional plan I prefer a way more
            development.<br />
            I would describe myself as someone who smiles a lot, like to talk
            and exchange with people but I'm definitly passionate by IT. Oh and
            my biggest default I think is that I'm such a bad loser...<br />

          <p>
            During this internship at Auchan's head office, I've been in charge of the well working of the network (server) of the park
            of around 100 persons working there, I also had to help them if they needed and fix them problems. I did stuff such as installing pre-configured windows,
            updating it etc. As soon as someone had a problem related to their computer/network it was my job to fix it.<br />
            I also assited to meeting in common with another site in another city, had to do weekly reports and many others missions.

            Teaching english during 2 months - January 2019
          </h6>
          <p>
            I went 2 months in Canada, more precisly in Calgary (Alberta) to
            meet my girlfriend but it was also a way for me to discover myself a
            bit more. <br />
            Having a bilingual level in English, I decided to test my skills by
            teaching kids in english (level 2) so they were knowing just words
            but not really able to make sentences.<br />
            That's also during this travel that I've made this website
            entirely.<br />
            This trip teached me how to live alone (cause it was the first time
            for me), moreover in a foreign country, and it gave me the chance to
            think about my future and what I wanted.
