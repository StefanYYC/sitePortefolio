          <p>
            Since I was in middle school, IT has been a hobby of mine. I knew
            then that it was a passion i want to pursue.
            <br />
            Currently, my main focus is in web development and all around
            front-end. I do dabble with hardware from time to time.<br />
            I have a positive outlook in life, taking each experience whether
            good or bad, as a stepping stone for success. <br />

          <h3>Internship in Auchan, Croix</h3>
          <h6>Network Intern for May - June 2017</h6>
          <p>
            During this internship at Auchan's head office, I've been in charge
            of maintaining the network (server) of the park of around 100
            employees, assisting them with day-to-day logistics. Examples of
            tasks are: installing pre-configured windows, updating it etc. As
            soon as someone had a problem related to their computer/network, it
            was my job to fix it.<br />
            I also visited other sites for meetings with other developers and
            creating weekly reports.

            Teaching English during 2 months - January 2019
          </h6>
          <p>
            I went 2 months in Calgary, Canada to visit my girlfriend but also
            to discover myself a more. <br />
            Having a bilingual level in English, I decided to test my skills by
            teaching kids in english (level 2).<br />
            During this trip, I've made this website entirely.<br />
            This trip taught me how to live alone (cause it was the first time
            for me) in a foreign country, and it gave me the chance to think
            about my future plans both for professional and personal growth &
            development.
